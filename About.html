                    The events of Spellbuild take place in Kings Canyon National Park
                    located at California, United States. Kings Canyon is also home
                    to Redwood Canyon, the largest remaining grove of sequoia trees 
                    in the world. Everything changed as if nothing happened. Magic
                    to the world and filled the world with lots of magical stuff.
                    There was a magic war that happened in 2148. The impact is still
                    going until now. People are becoming battlemages to fight each
                    other until the last man is standing.
